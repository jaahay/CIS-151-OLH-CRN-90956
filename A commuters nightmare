> Sometimes we take for granted how networks can impact our lives, especially when there is an outage. Earlier this year, it was a commuters nightmare when B.A.R.T announced the system was completely down. We rely a lot on our grids like the transportation, energy and financial sectors to be up and running 24/7.  Your mission is to research what happened and answer the following questions: 
1) What time did the system go down?
2) How long was it down for?
3) How did commuters get across the bay?  (list at least 2 ways)
4) What was done to restore service?
5) What does management need to do to avoid this from happening again? (long term fix)?

1) What time did the system go down?
In the morning of May 9th, 2025 the BART system went down. At about 3am, operations control center noticed intermittent visibility of computer systems on the network. BART issued its first service advisory at 4:30am.
To reiterate, all of BART was down.

2) How long was it down for?
Service resumed at around 9am that same morning, lapsing approximately 6 hours.

3) How did commuters get across the bay?  (list at least 2 ways)
"... thousands of riders jump[ed] into their cars and crowd[ed] the Bay Bridge toll plaza." "For many, the ferry was the fastest option in the morning with traffic on the bridge."

4) What was done to restore service?
The whole entire network system was taken offline due to a faulty, redundant piece of the networking system. Network monitoring services were taken offline. During the incident a specific piece of hardware was determined to be flooding the system and subsequently unplugged. This worked and service resumed.
"Riders experienced major delays to all destinations as services came back online"

5) What does management need to do to avoid this from happening again? (long term fix)?
Based upon an analysis performed by a third-party, it is important that track switch control systems are correctly configured so that this issue may not happen again. Several new network switches were configured to mitigate further issues.
Several options need to vetted for better mitigation of such problems. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) should be contacted to discuss more service interruption communications. BART's alternatives service should be sensitive to traffic load to better make suggestions based on service contention.

"This was not an issue with the train control system, this was an issue with computer topography and the ability to see and control the train control system."
