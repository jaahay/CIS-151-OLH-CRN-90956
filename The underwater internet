Countries, companies and culture all heavily depend on the internet for connectivity.

Petty and grand crimes would go unchecked. Would the judicial system flop? Yet my ultimate concern would be at the geopolitical level where we would have no transparency at all at what foreign nations may be up to. Terrorism? Mass destruction? Warfare?
