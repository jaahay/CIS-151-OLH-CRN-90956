* New Money: The Greatest Wealth Creation Event in History
** This video is dated Jul 30, 2019. It is currently Sept of 2025. The link to the "free investment report" leads to a broken or removed page.
** The video does not provide much quantifiable data. Clearly biased towards investors - I'm referring to infrastructure, availability and sustainability. I need to know how public services will function going forward, like food, housing, medicine and the treatment of underrepresented minorities.
** I want to know more about how China stores data and conducts its telecommunication services.
** What is the process to register and obtain business licenses? How are personal and business account managed?
** I'm not thrilled that China is playfully referred to as a dictatorship; that "all countries are lying about their numbers. I don't care."
* Oakland Firm Ramping Up Production Of 3D Printed Homes
** Printable housing sounded very affordable, but it must be much more complicated than approx. $200,000.
** I wonder what the marketing and sales strategy is.
** What other factors would closely relate to a potential customer's decision making process?
** Could I live there? Would the furnishing be 3D printed? Doors, for example?
* AGROBOT Robotic Strawberry Harvester
** When I was a teenager I (over-)thought a lot about food economics.
** How much money will I need to purchase the amount of groceries I desire. 
** How many people are involved and what are they doing.
** All the ethical considerations.
** This video just added onto my imagination :)
