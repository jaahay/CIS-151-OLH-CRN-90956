Discussion - A commuters nightmare
Sometimes we take for granted how networks can impact our lives, especially when there is an outage. Earlier this year, it was a commuters nightmare when B.A.R.T announced the system was completely down. We rely a lot on our grids like the transportation, energy and financial sectors to be up and running 24/7.  Your mission is to research what happened and answer the following questions: 
1) What time did the system go down?

2) How long was it down for?

3) How did commuters get across the bay?  (list at least 2 ways)

4) What was done to restore service?

5) What does management need to do to avoid this from happening again? (long term fix)? 

Post your analysis, then reply to two students for full credit.
