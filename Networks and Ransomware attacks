Your mission is to locate a company or organization that was hit with a ransomware attack.  These are affecting all sectors from universities, cities/municipalities and even the food industry.  List and describe the company/agency or school, how much was the ransom? Did they pay it?    (Note: some cities refused to pay and decided to re-build their networks from scratch).  How do they intend to protect their networks from future breaches? These have occurred right here in the Bay Area.

In late 1989, 20,000 floppy discs were mailed to patrons of the World Health Organization's AIDs conference. The disc was supposedly holding medical research data. Instead it performed a vicious yet clandestine set of instructions that would eventually lock the computer from any meaningful interactivity. At that point, a ransom note would appear on the screen demanding several hundred dollars be sent via mail to a PO Box in Panama. Medical institutions and organizations comprised some of the victims of the attack.
The attack itself was reversible within reason. The attack was quite benign as it did not alter any data. The attack was conducted by an individual. The ransom money itself would not have been enough to offset the time, energy and cost of having to execute the attack.
Being one of - if not the first - ransomware incident, the monetary damage was negligible. Whether or not victims paid out a few hundred dollars to save their medical research data seems inconsequentially. Rather, this event heralded the coming of cybersecurity.
The perpetrator was apprehended and the event details were published. It seems that the affected attendees of the conference were able to recover organically.
